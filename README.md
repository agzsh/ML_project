### Abstract
This study explores decision tree classifiers for mushroom classification, focusing on different splitting criteria, hyperparameter tuning, and pruning techniques. Three initial trees using Gini, Entropy, and Misclassification criteria were trained, with the Entropy-based tree performing best initially. Hyperparameter tuning identified Gini as the optimal model, achieving 93.18% accuracy. Pruning slightly reduced accuracy to 92.24%, improving generalization. Cross-validation and 0-1 loss confirmed model robustness. Feature importance analysis highlighted key attributes influencing classification. The results demonstrate that properly tuned and pruned decision trees balance accuracy and interpretability effectively.
